            <h1>Match Time Scaling</h1>
            <p>
               Match time scaling is a core system of Subjugation which effects how the game ramps and becomes more intense over time. The things effected by MTS are: Respawn Times, Gold Income /s, Control Point Limits, Horde Size, Signature Ability Unlocks and  Conqueror Stats. Time scaling starts slowly after 1 minute slowly ramps up overtime stopping at its maximum at 15 minutes. This splits the game up into 3 parts Early Game, Mid Game and Late Game.
            </p>
            <h4>Respawn Times</h4>
            <p>
               Respawn times are how long it takes a Conqueror to respawn after being slain in battle, initially this time is only 15 seconds and slowly ramps up over time up to 40 seconds over the match.
            </p>
            <h4>Horde Size</h4>
            <p>
               The maximum number of minions that can follow a Conqueror increases though out the course of a match beginning at 8 minions this amount scales to a maximum of 25 minions.
            </p>
            <h4>Gold Income /s</h4>
            <p>
               As the Horde size increase so too must the amount of gold needed to accommodate this, however the game does to increase player gold overtime, gold only increases by owning gold mines. This makes gold mines and invaluable resource to own and defend.
            </p>
            <h4>Control Point Limits</h4>
            <p>
               This is detailed in the Base Minions Spawning & Control Point Limiting segment.
            </p>
            <h4>Signature Ability Unlocks</h4>
            <p>
               As detailed in the Abilities section Signature abilities are very powerful and are unlocked after some time, the time to unlock signatures varies from Conqueror to Conqueror but usually it is around the Mid Game at roughly 3 minutes.
            </p>
            <h4>Conqueror Stats</h4>
            <p>
               With the increase in the number of minions on the map over the course of the match Conquerors can start feeling weaker as time goes on, to compensate this some Conqueror stats increase slowly over time. The main stats that increase are health and damage, increasing by a factor of 30% from 5 to 15 minutes (1% every 20 seconds).
