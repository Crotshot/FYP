# Subjugation
The unity project files for Subjugation.

## What is Subjugation?
Subjugation is a 3rd person 1 vs 1 MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). Similarly, to other
MOBAs Subjugation’s map has two bases at opposing sides of the map and players fight to capture
the enemy’s base.

Players control a Conqueror and can use their unique strengths/abilities along with an armada of
minions they command to help dominate the map and win the game.

### Pregame
Before entering a match, players can select one of five Conquerors to play and four of twelve different minion types, this
allows for a large variety of playstyles and strategies to be used.

### The Map
Subjugation’s map is broken down into tiles and most of these map tiles are randomly generated
and capturable by players. There are a variety of different capturable tiles and each offer some form
of bonus resource or strategic value. The map is generated on one side and then mirrored through
its centre so that both players have the area for fairness.

### Control Points
There are five controls points on the map, 1 in the centre and 2 on each players side of the map,
players need to capture the centre control point and at least 1 control point on either side of the
map in order to be able to capture the enemy base. To help players in there mission the game
creates ‘Base Minions’ that go to control points and fight to control them.

### Gameplay
The game uses WASD controls for movement, the player characters attempt to attack towards the players mouse.
Each conqueror has a passive ability and three active abilities, each conqueror has a unique kit and plays differently
to the others.
Players purchase minions from spawners in their base to follow them, minions follow a variety of commands from the player to
enable different forms of strategic gameplay. Minons despite being combat units they are also a resource that can be sacrificed
in structures around the map to gain a resource or strategic advantage over your oppponent
