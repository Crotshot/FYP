# Subjugation

## A game of rats and warfare


### What is Subjugation?
Subjugation is a 3rd person 1 vs 1 MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). Similarly, to other
MOBAs Subjugation’s map has two bases at opposing sides of the map and players fight to capture
the enemy’s base.\
Players control a Conqueror and can use their unique strengths/abilities along with an armada of
minions they command to help dominate the map and win the game.\

### Pregame
Before entering a match, players can select a Conqueror to play and four different minion types, this
allows for a large variety of playstyles and strategies to be used. I would like to implement 5
Conquerors and 12 minion units.\

### The Map
Subjugation’s map is broken down into tiles and most of these map tiles are randomly generated
and capturable by players. There are a variety of different capturable tiles and each offer some form
of bonus resource or strategic value. The map is generated on one side and then mirrored through
its centre so that both players have the area for fairness.\

### Control Points
There are five controls points on the map, 1 in the centre and 2 on each players side of the map,
players need to capture the centre control point and at least 1 control point on either side of the
map in order to be able to capture the enemy base. To help players in there mission the game
creates ‘Base Minions’ that go to control points and fight to control them.\

#### Aesthetic
The game will be low poly with a cartoony feel, the game world will have many randomly placed
props throughout.\

#### Creative Innovation
• Original Assets -> I will be making all the models, textures, sounds, animations etc myself\
• Fresh new take on the MOBA genre: It is a unique take on the genre, most MOBAs typically\
are 3v3 or 5v5 and are Isometric/Birds Eye, I am creating a 1v1 MOBA that is 3rd person.
• Random generation: Using random generation when creating the map to add replay ability
and something different every match\
• Selection of unique characters: A variety of different characters to choose form to suit
different playstyles\

#### Theoretical investigation
• Multiplayer Code\
• Designs of other MOBAs -> Researching other MOBAs to see what makes them successful
and how I could apply that to my design\
• AI management -> I will need to do research on how to efficiently a large quantity of AI\
• Live navmesh baking -> As the game has a different map every match creating navmeshes
will need to be done in game\
• Efficient Design -> Proper usage of a fitting game design pattern when making the game\

#### Development Technologies
• Unity - Engine\
• Blender – 3D assets\
• GNU Image Manipulation Program – 2D assets\
• BFXR & Homemade – Sound\
