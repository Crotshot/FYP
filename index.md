## An Introduction
This is the GitHub pages for my final year project, Subjugation! It will contain most of the content contained within the GDD of the game and a some extra information here an there. If you want to read the GDD instead it is inside of the Docs folder in the repository.&nbsp;

So, what it Subjugation?&nbsp;

Subjugation is a 3rd person 1 vs 1 MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)&nbsp;

Similarly, to other MOBAs Subjugation’s map has two bases at opposing sides of the map and players fight to capture the enemy’s base. Players control a Conqueror and can use their unique strengths/abilities along with an armada of minions they command to help dominate the map and win the game.&nbsp;

Before entering a match, players can select a Conqueror to play and four different minion types, this allows for a large variety of playstyles and strategies to be used.&nbsp;

Subjugation’s map is broken down into tiles and many of these tiles are randomly generated and can be captured by players to reap bonuses to help them win the game.&nbsp;
