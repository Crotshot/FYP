            <h1>Abilities</h1>
            <p>
               Abilities are core to the game and have a large effect on how a game plays out when they are used to their maximum potential. Conquerors each have 4 abilities and minions typically only have one ability.
            </p>
            <h4>Conqueror Ability Basics</h4>
            <p>
               As just mentioned, Conquerors have 4 abilities. They are what make each individual Conqueror unique to play, the description of the following ability types are not set in stone and their power and synergy within a kit fluctuates from Conqueror to Conqueror. They are as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>Passive</b> – This ability does not have a button to be activated and activates based on conditions and cooldowns by itself. A passive is typically something small that can help an Conqueror at any point during a match, an example passive: (“Rage” – Increase damage by 1% per missing percent health) or (“Reaction” – When damaged gain a damage shield for 20% max health for 3 seconds. Cooldown 10 seconds)
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>Spam-able</b> – Spam-ables are abilities with a low cooldown which can be used many times in a single fight, they have a relatively small effect that does little but as they can be used many times lots of small effects can build up.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Special</b> – Specials are a more power spam-ables on longer cooldowns, they could be used 1-3 times in a fight and require timing and a bit of knowledge to be used correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>Signature</b> – These abilities have very long cooldowns and have a very powerful effect in a fight, similar to specials knowing when to use them to get their full effect is key to success in the outcome of a fight. Signature abilities are locked behind Match Time Scaling at the start of the match.
            </p>

            <h4>Minion Ability Basics</h4>
            <p>
               As mentioned in the Abilities paragraph minions typically only have one ability. A minions ability is usually quite weak on its own and needs to be paired with other minion/Conqueror abilities to become effective. Most minion abilities are passives that activate under certain conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
               Some minions don’t have an ability per say but instead they might have greater stats in some areas to gain advantage over their ability counterparts.
